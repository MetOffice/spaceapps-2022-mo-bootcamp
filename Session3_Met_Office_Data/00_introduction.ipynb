    "\n",
    "September 2022\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>Authors: Harvey South<sup>1,2</sup>, Nathan Creaser<sup>1</sup>\n",
    "<br>[Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/)<sup>1</sup>, [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/)<sup>2</sup>\n",

    "\n",
    "This series of notebooks introduces various publicly available data produced by the [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/), demonstrating the use of this data is generally performed through exploring then engineering the data to be suitable for [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) visualizations. The series of notebooks was made to prepare readers for the September 2022 [NASA Space Apps Challenge](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/) as well as providing a resource for the Met Office Data Science Community of Practice and their partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "The intended audience of this notebook are readers enthusiastic for, though unfamiliar with environmental data science tools, however some awareness of the tools will help:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Python](https://www.python.org), including a portion of the built-in module library\n",
    "- Data manipulation tools: [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org), [NumPy](https://numpy.org), [Iris](https://scitools-iris.readthedocs.io/), [Xarray](https://xarray.dev)\n",
    "- Visualisation tools: [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)\n",
    "\n",
    "If inclined: See the links provided in [References](#References), and skim the \"User/Usage Guide\" or \"Quickstart Tutorial\" on each tool for a brief self-introduction to the technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "You should expect to gain the following knowledge and skills from working through this material:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how to access and download various types of data produced the [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk)\n",
    "  - Gridded and point based model forecast outputs from [DataHub](https://metoffice.apiconnect.ibmcloud.com/metoffice/production/)\n",
    "  - Weather observational data from [WOW](https://www.wow.metoffice.gov.uk/)\n",
    "  - Climate, Model, or Aircraft Sensor, data from open access [CEDA](https://ceda.ac.uk/) datasets\n",
    "- Read different data formats into [Python](https://www.python.org), choosing suitable data manipulation tools\n",
    "- Use data manipulation tools to select, modify, reformat, and learn more about data for conversion into desirable forms for visualizations\n",
    "- Produce simple visualizations of [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk) data\n",
    "- Generalize and apply the knowledge in these notebooks to form and produce original ideas that make use of weather and climate data\n",

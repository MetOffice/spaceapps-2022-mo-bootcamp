# Session 2 - Introduction to Machine Learning for Environmental/Meteorological Science

In this session, we will take a look at some simple Machine Learning techniques that can be used with Meteorological and Environtental science data

### Creating python Environments with conda 

[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/) is Package, dependency and environment management for any language---Python, R, Ruby, Lua, Scala, Java, JavaScript, C/ C++, FORTRAN

If you don't already have Conda, [install miniconda here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

* To create the python env using conda, in the command line execute this command from this directory 

```bash
conda env create --file requirements.yml
```

* Activate your environment using 

```bash
conda activate spaceapps-mo-envsci
```

* Once your conda environment is activated, launch jupyter lab web interface by running the following command 

```bash
jupyter lab
```
